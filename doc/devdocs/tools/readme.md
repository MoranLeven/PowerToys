# PowerToys tools

Tools in PowerToys are standalone apps and scripts that run outside of the PowerToys runner. They help developers and users to debug and test PowerToys features.

The source code of the tools can be found in the [tools folder](/tools). The compiled tools are saved under `{PowerToysInstallPath}\tools`.

## Overview of the tools

Following tools are currently available:

* [BugReportTool](bug-report-tool.md) - a tool to collect logs and system information for bug reports.
* [Build tools](build-tools.md) - a set of scripts that help building PowerToys.
* [Monitor info report](monitor-info-report.md) - a small diagnostic tool which helps identifying WinAPI bugs related to the physical monitor detection.
